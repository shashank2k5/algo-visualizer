# 🔍 Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive **Algorithm Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to help understand how sorting algorithms work step by step through visual animations.

This project is designed for learning purposes and demonstrates the internal working of popular sorting algorithms in a simple and intuitive way.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Random bars are generated with different heights.
2. Each bar represents a numeric value.
3. Sorting algorithms operate on these values.
4. Comparisons and swaps are visualized using animations and color changes.
5. The final sorted array is displayed visually.
